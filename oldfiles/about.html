		<br />
		Nowadays, people are more inclined than ever to travel, every time that a person has a break, a vacation or even a holiday its first idea is always jump into a travel. Why? Because it is fun, relaxing and interesting. We propose a software that will assist the user when planning for a trip. This app will give the user a guideline in what to do, where to sleep, what to eat and things like that. Basically, the software will be a useful, efficient, easy and convenient tool for planning a trip or tracking data about travel needs. Although this app can be really helpful, it will not to give the user a detailed information, in other words, the user cannot rely only on this app while traveling.
